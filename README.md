# 📌 Real-Time Object Classification Using OpenCV, TensorFlow & Tkinter  
A full end-to-end system where you:

1. Capture images from webcam  
2. Train a CNN model  
3. Predict objects in real time  

All class names are taken **at runtime**, so you can classify anything you want (e.g., *bottle*, *hand*).
